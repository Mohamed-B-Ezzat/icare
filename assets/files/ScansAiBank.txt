Computed tomography (CT) of the head uses special x-ray equipment to help assess head
  injuries, severe headaches, dizziness, and other symptoms of aneurysm, bleeding, stroke, and
  brain tumors. It also helps your doctor to evaluate your face, sinuses, and skull or to plan
  radiation therapy for brain cancer. In emergency cases, it can reveal internal injuries and
  bleeding quickly enough to help save lives.
  Tell your doctor if there's a possibility you are pregnant. Discuss any recent illnesses, medical
  conditions, medications you're taking, and allergies. If your exam needs intravenous contrast,
  your doctor may tell you not to eat or drink anything for a few hours beforehand. If you have a
  known allergy to contrast material, your doctor may prescribe medications to reduce the risk of
  an allergic reaction. Leave jewelry at home and wear loose, comfortable clothing. You may need
  to change into a gown for the procedure. <>What is CT Scanning of the Head? <>Computed tomography, more commonly known as a CT or CAT scan, is a diagnostic medical
  imaging test. Like traditional x-rays, it produces multiple images or pictures of the inside of the
  body. A CT scan generates images that can be reformatted in multiple planes. It can even
  generate three-dimensional images. Your doctor can review these images on a computer monitor,
  print them on film or via a 3D printer, or transfer them to a CD or DVD. CT images of internal
  organs, bones, soft tissue, and blood vessels provide greater detail than traditional x-rays. This is
  especially true for soft tissues and blood vessels. CT scanning provides more detailed
  information on head injuries, stroke, brain tumors, and other brain diseases than regular x-rays. <>What are some common uses of the procedure? <>Doctors typically use head CT to detect:
  # bleeding, brain injury and skull fractures in patients with head injuries.
  # bleeding caused by a ruptured or leaking aneurysm in a patient with a sudden severe
  headache.
  # a blood clot or bleeding within the brain in a patient with symptoms of a stroke.
  # a stroke, especially with a technique called CT Perfusion of the Head.
  # brain tumors.
  # enlarged brain cavities (ventricles) in patients with hydrocephalus.
  # diseases or malformations of the skull.Doctors also perform head CT to:
  # evaluate the extent of bone and soft tissue damage in patients with facial trauma, and plan
  surgical reconstruction.
  # diagnose diseases of the temporal bone on the side of the skull, which may be causing
  hearing problems.
  # determine whether inflammation or other changes are present in the paranasal sinuses.
  # plan radiation therapy for cancer of the brain or other tissues.
  # guide the passage of a needle used to obtain a tissue sample (biopsy) from the brain.
  # assess aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, and blood vessels through a technique
  called CT angiography. <>How should I prepare? <>Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing to your exam. You may need to change into a gown for
  the procedure. Metal objects, including jewelry, eyeglasses, dentures, and hairpins, may affect
  the CT images. Leave them at home or remove them prior to your exam. Some CT exams will
  require you to remove hearing aids and removable dental work. Women will need to remove bras
  containing metal underwire. You may need to remove any piercings, if possible. Your doctor
  may instruct you to not eat or drink anything for a few hours before your exam if it will use
  contrast material. Tell your doctor about all medications you are taking and if you have any
  allergies. If you have a known allergy to contrast material, your doctor may prescribe
  medications (usually a steroid) to reduce the risk of an allergic reaction. To avoid unnecessary
  delays, contact your doctor well before the date of your exam. Also tell your doctor about any
  recent illnesses or other medical conditions and whether you have a history of heart disease,
  asthma, diabetes, kidney disease, or thyroid problems. Any of these conditions may increase the
  risk of an adverse effect. The radiologist also should know if you have asthma, multiple
  myeloma or any disorder of the heart, kidneys or thyroid gland, or if you have diabetesâ€”
  particularly if you are taking Metformin. Women should always inform their physician and the
  CT technologist if there is any possibility that they may be pregnant. <>Who interprets the results and how do I get them? <>A radiologist, a doctor specially trained to supervise and interpret radiology exams, will analyze
  the images. The radiologist will send an official report to the doctor who ordered the exam.
  You may need a follow-up exam. If so, your doctor will explain why. Sometimes a follow-up
  exam further evaluates a potential issue with more views or a special imaging technique. It may
  also see if there has been any change in an issue over time. Follow-up exams are often the best
  way to see if treatment is working or if a problem needs attention. &
Computed tomography (CT) of the chest uses special x-ray equipment to examine abnormalities
found with other imaging tests and to help diagnose the cause of unexplained cough, shortness of
breath, chest pain, fever, and other chest symptoms. CT scanning is fast, painless, noninvasive,
and accurate. Because it can detect very small nodules in the lung, chest CT is especially
effective for diagnosing lung cancer at its earliest, most curable stage.
Tell your doctor if there is a possibility you are pregnant and discuss any recent illnesses,
medical conditions, medications you are taking, and allergies. You may be instructed not to eat
or drink anything for a few hours beforehand. If you have a known allergy to contrast material,
your doctor may prescribe medications to reduce the risk of an allergic reaction. These
medications must be taken beginning 12-13 hours prior to your exam. Leave jewelry at home and
wear loose, comfortable clothing. You may need to change into a gown for the exam. <>What is CT Scanning of the Chest? <>Computed tomography, more commonly known as a CT or CAT scan, is a diagnostic medical

there from other parts of the body.
# assess whether tumors are responding to treatment.
# help plan radiation therapy.
# evaluate injury to the chest, including the heart, blood vessels, lungs, ribs and spine.Chest CT can demonstrate various lung disorders, such as:
# benign and malignant tumors
# pneumonia
# tuberculosis
# bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis
# inflammation or other diseases of the pleura (the covering of the lungs)
# interstitial and chronic lung disease
# congenital abnormalities <>How should I prepare? <>Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing to your exam. You may need to change into a gown for

create and interpret CT scans of the body, radiologists can more easily diagnose problems such
as cancer, cardiovascular disease, infectious disease, appendicitis, trauma and musculoskeletal
disorders. ,What are some common uses of the procedure? ,CT imaging is:
# one of the fastest and most accurate tools for examining the chest, abdomen and pelvis
because it provides detailed, cross-sectional views of all types of tissue.
# used to examine patients with injuries from trauma such as a motor vehicle accident.
# performed on patients with acute symptoms such as chest or abdominal pain or difficulty
breathing.
# often the best method for detecting cancers in the chest, abdomen and pelvis, such as
lymphoma and cancers of the lung, liver, kidney, ovary and pancreas. It's considered the
best method since the image allows a physician to confirm the presence of a tumor,
measure its size, identify its precise location and determine the extent of its involvement
with other nearby tissue.
# an examination that plays a significant role in the detection, diagnosis and treatment of
vascular diseases that can lead to stroke, kidney failure or even death. CT is commonly
used to assess for pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in the lung vessels) as well as for
aortic aneurysms.
In pediatric patients, CT imaging is often used to evaluate:
# lymphoma
# neuroblastoma
# kidney tumors
# congenital malformations of the heart, kidneys and blood vessels
# cystic fibrosis
# complications of acute appendicitis
# complications of pneumonia
# inflammatory bowel disease
# severe injuries
Radiologists and radiation oncologists often use the CT examination to:
# quickly identify injuries to the lungs, heart and vessels, liver, spleen, kidneys, bowel or
other internal organs in cases of trauma.
# guide biopsies and other procedures such as abscess drainages and minimally invasive
tumor treatments.
# plan for and assess the results of surgery, such as organ transplants or gastric bypass.
# stage, plan and properly administer radiation treatments for tumors as well as monitor
response to chemotherapy.
# measure bone mineral density for the detection of osteoporosis. <>How should I prepare?

 Computed tomography angiography (CTA) uses an injection of contrast material into your blood
vessels and CT scanning to help diagnose and evaluate blood vessel disease or related
conditions, such as aneurysms or blockages. CTA is typically performed in a radiology
department or an outpatient imaging center.
Tell your doctor if there is a possibility you are pregnant and discuss any recent illnesses,
medical conditions, medications you are taking, and allergies. You will be instructed not to eat or
drink anything several hours beforehand. If you have a known allergy to contrast material, your
doctor may prescribe medications to take before the CTA exam to reduce the risk of an allergic
reaction. Leave jewelry at home and wear loose, comfortable clothing. You may be asked to
wear a gown. If you are breastfeeding, talk to your doctor about how to proceed. <>What is CT Angiography?
  <>Doctors use angiography to diagnose and treat blood vessel diseases and conditions.
Angiography exams produce pictures of major blood vessels throughout the body. Some exams
use contrast material.
Doctors perform angiography using:
x-rays with catheters
computed tomography (CT)
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
CT angiography uses a CT scanner to produce detailed images of both blood vessels and tissues
in various parts of the body. During the exam, contrast material is injected through a small
catheter placed in a vein of the arm. A radiologic technologist will capture high-resolution CT
images while the contrast material flows through the blood vessels. <>What are some common uses of the procedure?
 <>CT angiography is helpful in examining blood vessels and the organs supplied by them in
various body parts, including:
# brain
# neck
# heart
# chest
# abdomen (such as the kidneys and liver)
# pelvis
# legs and feet
# arms and hands
Physicians use CT angiography to diagnose and evaluate many diseases of blood vessels and
related conditions such as:
# aneurysms
# blockages
# blood clots
# congenital (birth-related) abnormalities of the cardiovascular system, including the heart
# disorganized blood vessels, such as vascular malformations
# injury
# tumors
# vessel rupture or tears
Also, physicians use CT angiography to check blood vessels following surgery, such as:
# identify abnormalities, such as aneurysms, in the aorta, both in the chest and abdomen, or
in other arteries.
# detect atherosclerotic (plaque) disease in the carotid artery of the neck, which may limit
blood flow to the brain and cause a stroke.
# identify a arteriovenous malformation inside the brain or elsewhere.
# detect plaque disease that has narrowed the arteries to the legs and help prepare for
angioplasty/stent placement or surgery.
# detect disease in the arteries to the kidneys or visualize blood flow to help prepare for a
kidney transplant or stent placement.
# guide interventional radiologists and surgeons making repairs to diseased blood vessels,
such as implanting stents or evaluating a stent after implantation.
# detect injury to one or more arteries in the neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, or limbs
following trauma.
# evaluate arteries feeding a tumor prior to surgery or other procedures such as
chemoembolization or selective internal radiation therapy.
# identify dissection or splitting in the aorta in the chest or abdomen or its major branches.
# show the extent and severity of coronary artery disease and its effects and plan for an
intervention, such as a coronary bypass and stenting.
# examine pulmonary arteries in the lungs to detect pulmonary embolism (blood clots, such
as those traveling from leg veins) or pulmonary AVMs.
# look at congenital abnormalities in blood vessels, especially arteries in children (e.g.,
malformations in the heart or other blood vessels due to congenital heart disease).
# evaluate stenosis and obstructions of vessels. <>How should I prepare?
 <>Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing to your exam. You may need to change into a gown for

risk of an adverse effect. Women should always inform their physician and the CT technologist
if there is any possibility that they may be pregnant. If you are breastfeeding at the time of the
exam, ask your doctor how to proceed. It may help to pump breast milk ahead of time. Keep it on
hand for use until all contrast material has cleared from your body (about 24 hours after the test).
However, the most recent American College of Radiology (ACR) Manual on Contrast Media
reports that studies show the amount of contrast absorbed by the infant during breastfeeding is
extremely low. <>Who interprets the results and how do I get them?
 <>A radiologist, a doctor specially trained to supervise and interpret radiology exams, will analyze
